# Shaping Up With Angular.js Example App

[Code School](http://codeschool.com/) course on [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/).

## Setup ##

This application is just a collection of static files. Feel free to clone this
repository and open the [index.html](https://github.com/codeschool/ShapingUpWithAngular.js/blob/master/app/index.html) file in your browser.

Image assets for the course can be found in the [img](https://github.com/codeschool/ShapingUpWithAngular.js/tree/master/app/img) folder.

Some features require a server to be running. If you have node and npm
installed, you can run `npm install http-server -g`. Then run the `http-server`
command inside the `app` folder and you should be able to see the application
running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.

It is also available here to [edit in your browser on plunkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/LXETQi?p=preview).
